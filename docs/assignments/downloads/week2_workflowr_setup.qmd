## Overview

This assignment builds directly on the workflowr vignette:
<https://workflowr.github.io/workflowr/articles/wflow-01-getting-started.html>.
Your goal is to create a new workflowr project with a clean structure,
publish at least one analysis file, and make it available as a GitHub Pages site.

I don't expect that you necessarily use `workflowr` in the class or more generally, but
I think it is useful to see how the package takes a structured approach to:

1. Setting up a predictable project structure
2. Uses Git to support version control and reproducibility
3. Allows you to publish your reports easily at GitHub Pages accessible to others.

## Learning goals

- Initialize a workflowr project with a reproducible structure
- Knit analysis files with workflowr and track the build status
- Publish a workflowr site to GitHub Pages

## Setup requirements

Before starting, make sure you have:

- R and RStudio installed
- Git installed and configured (For help, see: https://happygitwithr.com)
- A GitHub account
- The `workflowr` package installed

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install once if needed
install.packages("workflowr")
```

## Tasks

### 1. Start a new workflowr project

Create a new project named something like `workflowr-<your-name>` in a location you can find later. The
`wflow_start` command will setup a new workflowr project in the speecified directory (by
default, it does not overwrite existing projects).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(workflowr) # load library
# wflow_start("~/Downloads/workflowr-michael")
```

Open the project in RStudio (File > Open Project) and review the default folders:
`analysis/`, `data/`, `code/`, `output/`, and `docs/`.

### 2. Create a new analysis file

Create a new analysis Rmarkdown file at `analysis/01-getting-started.Rmd`. You can use `wflow_open` if you wish, or just
File > New File > R Markdown. 

In the Rmd file, include the following:

- A short paragraph describing the project topic you plan to use this semester
- Add a small public domain data file to the `data/` folder (e.g., a CSV from data.gov or another public domain source).
- One code chunk that reads your data file from `data/` and prints a small summary (e.g., `str()` or `summary()`)

### 3. Build and check the site locally

Use workflowr to build the site and check its status.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
wflow_build("analysis/01-getting-started.Rmd") # build only one script
wflow_build() # build the whole site
wflow_status() # check the build status
```

### 4. Publish and commit with workflowr

Publish the new analysis page using workflowr so it is tracked by Git.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
wflow_publish("analysis/01-getting-started.Rmd", message = "Add initial analysis page") # committing your work to the repository
```

### 5. Push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages

After publishing (basically concretizing a change), connect the project to GitHub with your username:

Setup your Github repository using the `wflow_use_github` function.
I chose the Oauth route when prompted, but either is fine.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
wflow_use_github("myname")
```

Now push the code from your computer to Github

```{r, eval = FALSE}
wflow_git_push()
```

In GitHub, enable Pages for the `docs/` folder on the `main` branch.

Guidance here: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart

After configured, this should look like the following:
![](files/ghpages_settings.png)

After a few minutes of setting this, the top part of the GitHub Pages for the repo (`https://github.com/<username>/<reponame>/settings/pages`) should
look something like this:

![](files/ghpages_url.png)

### 6. Verify the published site

Open your GitHub Pages site and confirm:

- The home page loads
- Your analysis page appears in the navigation
- The analysis page renders your text and code output

### Deliverables

1. Provide the URL of your project site.
2. Short reflection (2-3 sentences) on what was straightforward vs. confusing, what you think
   may be helpful about this approach and/or what aspects you may adopt in your own workflows
